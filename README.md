# Startup Financials Analysis

## Project Overview

In this repository, we delve into an SQL-driven exploration of startup financials. The data originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and covers various aspects of startup performance, including funding stages, valuations, and the overall competitive landscape in different market sectors.

## Features

The SQL queries within this project serve to uncover key financial insights:

- The total number of companies and the sum of their valuations.
- The highest amounts raised at different funding stages.
- Founding years, pinpointing the oldest startups.
- Average valuations across categories, including detailed sector analysis.
- Competitive market analysis based on the number of companies within categories.
- Size analysis of startups across different locations.

## SQL Queries

The repository is structured around a series of SQL queries that progressively build a picture of the startup ecosystem:

1. Inspecting the database structure and summarizing company counts.
2. Aggregating financial metrics such as total and average valuations.
3. Categorizing data to highlight market competitiveness and location-based startup sizes.

## How to Use

To run these SQL queries, you will need access to a SQL database containing the `startups` table. Use a SQL interface like MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or a command-line tool to execute the queries found in the `queries.sql` file.

## File Descriptions

- `queries.sql` - Contains all the SQL queries used to analyze the startups data.

## Project Tasks

Each task in the project is designed to highlight a different aspect of SQL-based data analysis, focusing on real-world applicability in the context of business and finance.
